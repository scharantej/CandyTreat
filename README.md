## Flask Application Design
### 1. HTML Files
#### a) Base HTML Template:
Name: base.html
- Serves as the base template for other HTML files in the application.
- Contains common elements like header, navigation bar, and footer.

#### b) Home Page:
Name: index.html
- Content: Displays introductory information about the website, including a carousel showcasing various sweets, a section highlighting popular items, and a section explaining the benefits of buying sweets from your website.

#### c) Menu Page:
Name: menu.html
- Content: Displays the menu offering various categories of sweets. Each item includes an image, name, description, price, and 'Buy Now' button that adds the item to the cart.

#### d) Cart Page:
Name: cart.html
- Content: Shows the list of items added to the cart, along with the total cost. Contains buttons for removing items from the cart, updating quantities, and proceeding to checkout.

#### e) Checkout Page:
Name: checkout.html
- Content: Displays a form where users enter their contact and shipping information. Also includes options for payment methods (e.g., credit card, online banking).

### 2. Routes
#### a) Home Route:
- URL: '/'
- Purpose: Renders the home page, index.html

#### b) Menu Route:
- URL: '/menu'
- Purpose: Renders the menu page, menu.html

#### c) Cart Route:
- URL: '/cart'
- Purpose: Renders the cart page, cart.html, and contains functionality to add, remove, and update items in the cart.

#### d) Checkout Route:
- URL: '/checkout'
- Purpose: Renders the checkout page, checkout.html, and contains the logic for processing orders and payment.

### 3. Additional Considerations
- Implement a database to store information about sweets, user accounts, orders, and other relevant data.
- Utilize Flask's built-in session management feature to maintain user sessions and shopping carts.
- Employ server-side validation to ensure user-entered data is valid before processing it.
- Consider implementing a payment gateway integration for secure online payments.
